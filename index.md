## About Me

I am a MASc student specializing in machine learning and GAI-driven wireless communication. I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Statistics from York University, where I pursue my master degree under the supervision of [Prof. Hina Tabassum](https://sites.google.com/view/ngwn-research-lab/home?authuser=0) and [Prof. Ping Wang](https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~pingw/).

<!-- My research focuses on optimizing beyond-5G and 6G wireless systems through generative AI, intelligent resource allocation, and AI-enabled vehicular communication. I am particularly interested in developing scalable and reliable learning-based frameworks for autonomous driving, network orchestration, and next-generation communication systems. -->

Currently, my work explores resource-aware communication strategies, quantum-enhanced user association, diffusion models, and hybrid large language model (LLM)-assisted decision-making for joint autonomous driving and communication optimization.
